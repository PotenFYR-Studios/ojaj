      <p>
        OneJumpAllJump ships under <strong>Apache-2.0 with the Commons Clause</strong>: free to
        use, fork and build on, but not to sell. Here is what that means in plain language.
      </p>

      <h2 id="allowed">What you can do</h2>
      <p>The plugin is free for any purpose, commercial use included. You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run it on any Paper or Purpur server, for yourself or for others.</li>
        <li>Fork the repository and modify anything in it.</li>
        <li>Self-host it and redistribute it, in original or modified form.</li>
        <li>
          Build products or services around it: hosting, setup services, management tools, custom
          configs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="limits">What you cannot do</h2>
      <p>The Commons Clause adds a selling limit on top of Apache-2.0. You cannot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sell the software itself: offering the plugin jar as your paid product.</li>
        <li>
          Charge for a product or service whose value derives entirely or substantially from the
          plugin's own functionality.
        </li>
        <li>Use PotenFYR names, logos or trademarks to brand a derivative.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Running a Minecraft server, or a hosting company whose servers have OneJumpAllJump
        installed, is fine: customers pay for servers, support and uptime, not for the plugin.
      </p>

      <h2 id="notice">License notices</h2>
      <p>
        If you redistribute the plugin, keep the license notices with it, including the Commons
        Clause text. The{" "}
        <a href={`${REPO}/blob/master/LICENSE`} target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          LICENSE file
        </a>{" "}
        in the repository is the authoritative text; this page is a summary and never overrides it.
